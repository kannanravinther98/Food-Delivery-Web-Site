    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The Disaster Café has grown from humble beginnings. Originally a small cafe on the beach in Malacca, The Disaster Café has grown and developed into the loved restaurant we know it as now.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The Disaster Café is run by Tanja and Oli – a family duo. Originally from Germany, Tanja came to Malaysia many years ago and after falling in love with Oli, she decided to stay in Malacca for longer. They have created their own story in Malaysia by opening The Disaster Café.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Tanja has been responsible for the menu and running the kitchen. Oli leads a double life as a restaurateur by day and an artist by night; he has brought his passions together to create unique interior design for The Disaster Café. His artwork is frequently exhibited on the restaurant walls and he also accepts commission work.

    <h2> Our History</h2>
    <div class="History">
        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Before The Disaster Café was open, Tanja and Oli ran a popular backpackers place on Cenang beach. Hungry as backpackers are, they started asking for a light breakfast and coffee.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The Disaster Café was born to provide a simple hearty menu, European coffee, and a friendly atmosphere was what Malacca needed in 2000. The Disaster Café then opened the doors in 2004 to help tourists kill the hunger bug right on Cenang beach. <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a fun and lively place but The Disaster Café was expanding. In 2010, The Disaster Café moved to a new location and became the place as we know it today. Since then it has been one of the most popular western restaurants on Malacca and continues to serve simple yet delicious food to travellers and friends.
